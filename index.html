  - excerpt: '“I think of data science as more like a practice than a job. Think of the scientific method, where you have to have a problem statement, generate a hypothesis, collect data, analyze data and then communicate the results and take action…. If you just use the scientific method as a way to approach data-intensive projects, I think you’re more apt to be successful with your outcome.” *-* *Bob Hayes*'
