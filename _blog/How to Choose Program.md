# 6 Things to Consider When Choosing a Graduate Program in Data Science

It's no secret that data science is a popular career right now. Harvard Business review declared it the [*Sexiest Job of the 21st Century*](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century) and Glassdoor.com ranked it the [top job in America](https://www.glassdoor.com/List/Best-Jobs-in-America-LST_KQ0,20.htm) 4 years in a row. Basically, its a great time to become a data scientist.

But how does someone become a data scientist? Truth be told, there are a lot of different ways to become a data scientist. With a job on everyone's list, the competition is tough. One way to set yourself apart from other candidates is to get a graduate degree. According to a [Burtch Works survey](https://www.burtchworks.com/2014/11/17/must-have-skills-to-become-a-data-scientist/), 91% of data scientists have at least a masters degree. Although the percent of data scientists with graduate degrees appears to be decreasing slightly, it is still a valuable asset to have when trying to break into the field.

If you decide graduate school is the route for you, there are some things you should consider before choosing a program. These are steps that helped me make a decision that I am happy with.

Scholarships, tuition reimbursement, self-pay, application fees, GRE, Transcripts
