This is a sample file for a data science project related to linear regression in python using scikitlearn.

This project will showcase my ability to use machine learning to predict outcomes of some event.

```python
import pandas as pd

s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print(s)

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv, header = True)
```

These results are really impressive. Thanks.
