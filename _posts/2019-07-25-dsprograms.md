It's no secret that data science is a popular career right now. Harvard Business review declared it the [*Sexiest Job of the 21st Century*](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century) and Glassdoor.com ranked it the [top job in America](https://www.glassdoor.com/List/Best-Jobs-in-America-LST_KQ0,20.htm) 4 years in a row. Basically, its a great time to become a data scientist.

But how does someone become a data scientist? Truth be told, there are a lot of different ways to become a data scientist. With a job on everyone's list, the competition is tough. One way to set yourself apart from other candidates is to get a graduate degree. According to a [Burtch Works survey](https://www.burtchworks.com/2014/11/17/must-have-skills-to-become-a-data-scientist/), 91% of data scientists have at least a masters degree. Although the percent of data scientists with graduate degrees appears to be decreasing slightly, it is still a valuable asset to have when trying to break into the field.

If you decide graduate school is the route for you, there are some things you should consider before choosing a program. These are steps will help you make sure to choose a program that gets you be best value for your time and money.


### 1. Price
tuition reimbursement, self-pay

The first thing to consider is price. How much will the program cost when all is said and done? Tuition and fees are typically the largest expenses in a graduate school. Does the school offer graduate scholarships that you are a good candidate for? If so, apply early so that you can take that into consideration before making a final decision.

Additionally, make sure to also include the cost of books, materials, and software as these things can quickly add up. If you are not able to find this information on the program website, reach out to the program chair or an alumni of the program via social media.

Another thing to think about is the cost of applying to the school. Do they require you to take the GRE, send official transcripts, or pay an application fee? Since these expenses are not covered by student loans, they are important to keep in mind. Nor that a $100 application fee should keep you from applying to your top school, it may be smart to apply to some 



### 2. Delivery

Another important thing to consider is course delivery. Is the program available online or in-class only? One benefit of online programs, is the convenience. You can attend class from the comfort of your home without traveling to a university. This is especially important if you are working while attending school.

Although online programs are more convenient, you miss out on several important benefits of an in-class program such as networking and relationship building. Graduate school is a great time to build connections and collaborate on projects. While not impossible online, you cannot beat face-to-face interaction.

### 4. Curriculum
