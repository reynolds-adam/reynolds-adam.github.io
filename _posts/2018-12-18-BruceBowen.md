A friend of mine created this cool visualization to compare 3pt shooting percentage vs free throw percentage for NBA players. Bruce Bowen is a strange case because his 3pt% was higher than his FT% in the 2002-03 NBA season. 

Check out how your favorite players stack up by searching in the box and clicking on the player's name.
