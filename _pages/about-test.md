# Hi, I'm Adam, an aspiring data scientist...
### ...musician, motorcycle rider, woodworker, traveler, hiker, chef, volleyballer, snowboarder, learner, and more.

I've always had a variety of interests. To put it simply, I like creating things, solving problems, and having experiences.  

------
## Woodworking
Ever since I was 8 years old, I've always loved building things. Recently, I've gotten into woodworking.

## Volleyball
On Tuesdays, I play on a local rec league volleyball team. Our team went from last to first in the span of 3 seasons. *(I'm so proud)*

## Hiking
I love taking advantage of the great hiking in Utah. The elevation in Utah ranges from 2,200 to 13,500 feet, so there is a wide variety of terrain to explore. There are also 5 national parks, 3rd most in any state.

## One of my coolest experiences...
...was when I went hang gliding in Arizona at sunset. Instead of jumping off a mountain, a small airplane towed the hang glider 2,000 feet in the air. The hang glider then released from the airplane and *glided* down from there.
